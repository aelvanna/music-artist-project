                >Jay B, Mark, Jackson, Jinyoung, Youngjae, BamBam, and
                Yugyeom.</strong
              >
              GOT7 debuted on January 16 2014 and have been nominated as Top
              Social Artist at Billboard Music Awards and charted #1 on iTunes
              in 42 differnt countries. This has allowed GOT7 to be identified
              as global artists with fans all over the world. Furthermore
              <strong>Mark, Jackson and BamBam</strong> are multilingual and are
              Taiwanese-American, Chinese and Thai respectively adding to the

              On January 2021, their contract with JYP Entertainment expired and
              all members left JYP entertainment and signed with different
              agencies to manage their solo careers, while choosing to also
              remain as GOT7 by partnering with Warner Music Korea. Despite
              being under Warner Music Korea, all copyright for their group name
              and previously released music were transferred to the members
              themselves.
            </p>

              One month later on February 2021, GOT7 released their Single
              <strong><i>"Encore"</i></strong
              >, which is dedicated to the fans, and represents their promise to
              continue on as GOT7 forever. After focusing on solo activities for
              around a year, GOT7 released their self-titled EP
              <strong><i>"GOT7"</i></strong> on May 23 2022. With this release,
              GOT7 launched new social media accounts and a new logo for the
              group accompanied with the phrase "GOT7 is our name". They also
              held their <strong><i>Homecoming 2022 Fancon"</i></strong> at SK
